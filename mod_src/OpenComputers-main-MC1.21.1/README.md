# OpenComputers for Minecraft 1.21.1

This repository is a community-maintained NeoForge port of the original
[OpenComputers](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers). It keeps the
classic Lua computers, robots, drones, component network, and OpenOS experience
on modern Minecraft.

> [!WARNING]
> The 1.21.1 port is under active development. Back up worlds before testing it,
> and expect incomplete integrations and compatibility work.

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.21.1
- NeoForge 21.1 or newer
- Java 21
- Scala is bundled in the OpenComputers JAR.

## Installation

Download a release or CI build and put the OpenComputers JAR in the instance's
`mods` directory:

- `opencomputers-*.jar`

ScalableCatsForce may remain installed when it is required by other mods.

## Building

Clone the repository and run:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build
```

On Linux or macOS, use `./gradlew build`. Java 21 is required. Build artifacts
are written to `build/libs`.

For an IntelliJ IDEA development environment, enable the Scala plugin and
import the repository as a Gradle project. Launch the game with the
`Minecraft Client` Gradle run configuration or the `runClient` Gradle task.
Do not run `net.neoforged.devlaunch.Main` directly; that bypasses ModDev's
launch preparation.

If IntelliJ reports that `build/moddev/clientRunVmArgs.txt` is missing, run:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat prepareClientRun
```

Then launch `Minecraft Client` or `runClient` again. The normal `runClient`
task already depends on `prepareClientRun`, including after `clean`.

## Project status

The port currently targets NeoForge 1.21.1. Remaining integrations and planned
features are tracked in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). The 
[OpenComputers wiki](https://ocr.michiyo.me/wiki) is useful for gameplay and Lua
API concepts.

## Using the API

API artifacts use the Maven coordinates `li.cil.oc:opencomputers` with the
`api` classifier. Published versions are available from:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url = "https://maven.michiyo.me/releases/" }
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly "li.cil.oc:opencomputers:<version>:api"
}
```

Match `<version>` to the release or build you target.
