 * This interface is implemented by the database component.
 * <br>
 * This allows getting actual item stack instances as referenced by callers
 * of other components' callbacks, without having to push a full representation
 * of an item stacks' NBT data to the VM (which can be both a memory and a
 * security issue).
 * <br>
 * To use this, you'll usually want to accept an address and either an index
 * or a hash in your component's callback function, the address being that of
 * a database component in the same network as your component. Alternatively
 * you can omit requiring an address and just loop through the other nodes on
 * the network to look for those that have a {@code Database} as host.
